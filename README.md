## Usage Guide

### First Time Setup

1. **Launch the App**: The app will request necessary permissions
2. **Grant Permissions**: Allow location, Bluetooth, and WiFi permissions
3. **Choose Mode**: Select either SOS mode (for emergencies) or Rescuer mode

### SOS Mode (Emergency Users)

1. **Activate SOS**: Tap the large red SOS button on the home screen
2. **Broadcasting**: The app automatically broadcasts distress signals
3. **Wait for Rescuers**: Nearby rescuers will receive your SOS signal
4. **Communicate**: Send messages when rescuers connect

### Rescuer Mode

1. **Enable Rescuer Mode**: Toggle the rescuer switch on the home screen
2. **Scan for SOS**: The app continuously scans for emergency signals
3. **Connect to SOS Devices**: Tap on detected devices to establish communication
4. **Coordinate**: Use chat to communicate with people in distress

### Background Operation

The app continues scanning and can receive connections even when:
- App is in background
- Device screen is off
- Other apps are running

## Configuration

### App Settings

- **Service Timeout**: Connection timeout duration
- **Scan Interval**: How frequently to scan for devices
- **Message Retention**: How long to keep old messages
- **Encryption Settings**: Security configuration

### Performance Tuning

- **Battery Optimization**: Disable battery optimization for continuous operation
- **Network Settings**: Configure WiFi and Bluetooth scanning intervals
- **Storage Management**: Regular cleanup of old messages and devices

## Development

### Code Generation

When modifying database schemas or data models:

```bash
# Clean existing generated files
dart run build_runner clean

# Regenerate all files
dart run build_runner build

# Watch for changes during development
dart run build_runner watch
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Analyze code quality
flutter analyze
```

### Adding New Features

1. **Services**: Add new communication protocols in `lib/src/services/`
2. **UI Screens**: Create new screens in `lib/src/ui/screens/`
