## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS

### Multi-Hop Mesh Networking Details
```dart
class MeshNetworkService {
  // Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path routing
  List<String> findShortestPath(String source, String destination)
  
  // TTL-based message forwarding with loop prevention
  Future<bool> forwardMessage(MeshMessage message)
  
  // Heartbeat topology management
  void startHeartbeat() // 30-second intervals
  
  // Message deduplication
  bool isDuplicateMessage(String messageId)
}
```

### Production Logger Implementation
```dart
class Logger {
  static void debug(String message, [String? tag])
  static void info(String message, [String? tag])
  static void warning(String message, [String? tag])
  static void error(String message, [String? tag])
  static void success(String message, [String? tag]) // NEW
}
```

### Enhanced ServiceCoordinator
- **Mesh Integration:** Automatic fallback to mesh routing when direct P2P fails
- **Device Discovery:** Enhanced with mesh neighbor management
- **Message Routing:** Intelligent routing through mesh topology
- **Error Recovery:** Automatic retry with different routing paths
